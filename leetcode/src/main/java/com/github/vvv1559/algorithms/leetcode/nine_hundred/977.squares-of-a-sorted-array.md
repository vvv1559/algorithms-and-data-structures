Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
```

Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
```

### Bruteforce solution
Let's start with thinking of the bruteforce solution. So we can iterate over the array and update every 
value to it's square. Then we can sort this array and get expected result.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int[] sortedSquares(int[] nums) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            nums[i] *= nums[i];
        }
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        return nums;
    }
}
```

What about the time complexity? The loop gives us `O(n)` and sort gives us `O(n*log(n))`. 
So in the end we wnd up with `O(n + n*log(n))`. And since we don't use extra memory - memory complexity will be `M(1)`.
Can we do better?

### Optimisation
It seems that we cannot get rid of the iterating over the array because we need to modify each value. But can we 
optimise sorting? If we thoroughly read the description it says that initial array is already sorted. But complexity is 
we have negative values which will be transformed to positives and will be inserted in the middle of the array.
But what we know:
* We have the biggest negative number on the most left position in the array and the biggest positive on the most right.
* Resulting array will consist only positive numbers, so the biggest squares will start ending up in the end of array.

In other words:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int[] sortedSquares(int[] nums) {
        int[] result = new int[nums.length];
        int negativesIndex = 0;
        int positivesIndex = nums.length - 1;
        for (int insertIndex = result.length - 1; insertIndex >= 0; insertIndex--) {
            int negativesSqr = nums[negativesIndex] * nums[negativesIndex];
            int positivesSqr = nums[positivesIndex] * nums[positivesIndex];

            if (negativesSqr > positivesSqr) {
                result[insertIndex] = negativesSqr;
                negativesIndex++;
            } else {
                result[insertIndex] = positivesSqr;
                positivesIndex--;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

Let's calculate final complexity. There is only 1 loop over array - this gives us `O(n)`. 
And since we are allocating one more array for the result - our memory complexity will be `M(n)`.
