# 557. Reverse Words in a String III (easy)

## Description

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string-iii/)

Given a string `s`, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and
initial word order.

**Example 1:**
> Input: s = "Let's take LeetCode contest"  
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"

**Example 2:**
> Input: s = "God Ding"  
Output: "doG gniD"


**Constraints:**

* `1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>`
* `s` contains printable **ASCII** characters.
* `s` does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
* There is **at least one** word in `s`.
* All the words in `s` are separated by a single space.

## Bruteforce solution

The simplest solution will be splitting our string by using space, rotating each word, and collecting our string back.

```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        String[] words = s.split(" ");
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            char[] word = words[i].toCharArray();
            for (int start = 0, end = word.length - 1; start < end; start++, end--) {
                char tmp = word[start];
                word[start] = word[end];
                word[end] = tmp;
            }
            words[i] = new String(word);
        }

        return String.join(" ", words);
    }
}
```

What about the time complexity? We need to iterate over all characters to perform split `O(n)`. We also iterate over all
characters to invert the word `O(n)`. Joining gives us `O(k)`, where k is number of words. So in the end we get
complexity of `O(n + k)`. As well, we allocate extra array of size `k` and this gives us `M(k)` memory consumption. Can
we do better?

## Optimisation

It seems that we allocate extra memory just to identify borders of words. We can achieve the same by trying to find next
space and then invert the word.

```java
public class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        int end = 0;
        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char ch = s.charAt(i);
            if (ch == ' ') {
                for (int j = i - 1; j > end; j--, end++) {
                    swap(chars, j, end);
                }
                end = i + 1;
            }
        }

        for (int j = chars.length - 1; j > end; j--, end++) {
            swap(chars, j, end);
        }


        return new String(chars);
    }

    private void swap(char[] chars, int fst, int snd) {
        char tmp = chars[fst];
        chars[fst] = chars[snd];
        chars[snd] = tmp;
    }
}
```

Let's calculate final complexity. As before, we iterate twice over array: first to find space, second - to reverse
chars. So this solution has `O(2 * n)` time complexity or simplified `O(n)`. And there is no extra memory
involved `M(1)`
