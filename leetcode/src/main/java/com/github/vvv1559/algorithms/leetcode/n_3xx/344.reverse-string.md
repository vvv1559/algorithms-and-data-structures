# 344. Reverse String (easy)

## Description

[Problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with `O(1)`
extra memory.

**Example 1:**
> Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]  
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

**Example 2:**
> Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]  
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]


**Constraints:**

* `1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup>`
* `s[i]` is a [printable ascii character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

## Bruteforce solution

There might be some solutions of this problem. But easiest one will be starting from two ends of our array and flip
values. We do this until our pointers meet each other.

```java
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        for (int start = 0, end = s.length - 1; start < end; start++, end--) {
            char tmp = s[start];
            s[start] = s[end];
            s[end] = tmp;
        }
    }
}
```

What about the time complexity? We have only one loop iterating one time over array. This gives us a `O(n)`. As well, we
met requirements of not allocating extra memory `M(1)`.
